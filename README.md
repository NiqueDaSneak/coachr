# Clarity:
# The idea for this app came during a conversation with a career coach. We discussed the troubles that a coach goes through trying to share information while also keeping in contact with clients in a way that isn't as archaic as email. The solution, Clarity. On this platform, a coach has the ability to invite their clients to join, keep track of the individuals they are working with, and input the individual goals each person has set. It also allows for real-time collaboration via a chat feature so that important questions don't get lost in the labyrinth of the gmail inbox.
